# Fuzzy Associative Memory App
Application for Calculating Satisfaction Level Using the Fuzzy Associative Memory (FAM) Method

The Fuzzy Associative Memory (FAM) method was first published by Bart Kosko. FAM is a system that maps one fuzzy set to another fuzzy set. FAM is a fuzzy version of Bidirectional Associative Memory. Simply put, FAM maps a fuzzy rule or a set of pairs (Ai,Bj)(Ai​,Bj​) that connects the fuzzy set BjBj​ to the fuzzy set AiAi​. A FAM system can consist of several different sets of FAM pairs: (A1,B1)(A1​,B1​), (A2,B2)(A2​,B2​), ... (AP,BP)(AP​,BP​).
